I spent the last hour or so migrating from Wordpress to [Jekyll][jekyll]. I am very pleased with the results so far. I used the jekyll-import gem to import my post's from Wordpress. It was able to grab the posts, but I had to manually fix the formatting and import the images. Luckily, I don't have many posts, so it didn't take long.

I decided to migrate because my free tier on AWS just ran out. I don't want to pay $15 per month just to host a blog, so I figured I would use Jekyll on github pages. As of writing, I haven't uploaded to github yet, so we'll see how that goes.
