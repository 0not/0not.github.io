Hi, my name is Kyle.  I am physics loving, electronic hacking, software programming, wilderness exploring kinda guy. This site is dedicated to that â€” the pursuit of knowledge in all its forms.  And fun.  Oh, most definitely fun.

If you want to contact me, please comment on one of my posts, send me a message, or follow me  ([@0not](http://twitter.com/0not), [github](http://github.com/0not)).

I came up with 0not.net one day as I was thinking up cool hacker-esque names. 0not.net is pronounced aught-not-dot-net.  Think of the second 0 in .30-06 ammunition (thirty-aught-six).

And this is my rendition of a stylized zero.
